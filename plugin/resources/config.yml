# Enable the plugin, false by default so you can configure it correctly
enable: false

# Example:
# if 'whitelist' set to true and 'versions' are 759 and 760 (1.19-1.19.2), only 1.19-1.19.2 versions will be able to join without having to join through nosupport.test.org
# if 'whitelist' set to false and 'versions' are 759 and 760 (1.19-1.19.2), only 1.19-1.19.2 versions will have to join through nosupport.test.org

# If set to false, plugin will act like a blacklist
whitelist: true
# Useful if you're using 'whitelist: false' and have many versions: https://via.krusic22.com
